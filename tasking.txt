Requirements:
Python 3.10 code that successfully uses a Discord Bot to periodically post to a specified server. For test case, just have it post "Lorem Ipsum" or "Hello World" to the server.
For items such as server details, credentials, times to post etc, please use a config file. ConfigParser, yaml, etc doesn't matter; whatever is easiest for you.

Deliverables:
- Instructions on how to run / what I need to do to replicate
- A requirements.txt file
- Working code/server example, including .py files and .config files

Expected LOE: < 10 hours
