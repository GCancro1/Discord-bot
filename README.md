# Discord bot for messaging

Python 3.10 code that successfully uses a Discord Bot to periodically post to a specified server.

## Getting started:

### Setting up environment

1. Make sure python3.10 and python3.10-venv are installed 
2. Run setup.sh 
3. Ask me for the discord_config.yml file which contains the bot and guild token keys

### Current progress

* Setup environment stuff
* Learning about Discord API
* Repeat-bot.py demonstrates basics of messaging in channels

### TODO

* Determine scheduling
* Figure out what will be sent, write script that can read config and input to output to text channel of choice
* Write script to call instance of discord bot and tear down instead of the 24/7 running of it
